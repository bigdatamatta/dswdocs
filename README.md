## Data Science Workbench

RocketML Data Science Workbench is a machine learning (ML) platform to enable Data scientists and ML engineers across your organization to easily build and deploy ML solutions at scale. 

Data Scientist's work is done in a project, which is a collection of workspaces and project files. Workspaces are single-node and multi-node CPU/GPU clusters with **read-only** access to data sources and **read-write** access to project files.
