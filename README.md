## Data Science Workbench

RocketML Data Science Workbench (DSW) is a machine learning (ML) platform to enable Data scientists and ML engineers across your organization to easily build and deploy ML solutions at scale. 


## Projects
Data Scientist's work is done in a project, which is a collection of workspaces and project files.

### Project Files
For every user, workbench creates a folder in your corporate S3 bucket. For every project created by a user, DSW creates a project folder in the user folder. Project folder name can be accessed from Projects Details page. All workspaces created in this project will have read-write access to project files folder. Any data, code, results can be stored in project files folder for future use.


## Workspaces
Workspaces are single-node and multi-node CPU/GPU clusters with **read-only** access to data sources and **read-write** access to project files.
